This is a dummy RAZOR project which was used to build a wwwroot. No other directories are being used.
The HTML UI is located in wwwroot for the Bikes Project. It does not use Razor infrastructure, or the VS Razor Build.
We decided to use this form as we may wish to upgrade our traditional UI to Razor pages to hide the API and DB call information.


./wwwroot/ (Has the Bikes UI).
